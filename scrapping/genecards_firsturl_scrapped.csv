1	alpha-1-B glycoprotein	[u'The protein encoded by this gene is a plasma glycoprotein of unknown function. The protein shows sequence similarity to the variable regions of some immunoglobulin supergene family member proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]']

2	alpha-2-macroglobulin	[u'Alpha-2-macroglobulin is a protease inhibitor and cytokine transporter. It inhibits many proteases, including trypsin, thrombin and collagenase. A2M is implicated in Alzheimer disease (AD) due to its ability to mediate the clearance and degradation of A-beta, the major component of beta-amyloid deposits. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]', u'Is able to inhibit all four classes of proteinases by a unique trapping mechanism. This protein has a peptide stretch, called the bait region which contains specific cleavage sites for different proteinases. When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a conformational change is induced in the protein which traps the proteinase. The entrapped enzyme remains active against low molecular weight substrates (activity against high molecular weight substrates is greatly reduced). Following cleavage in the bait region a thioester bond is hydrolyzed and mediates the covalent binding of the protein to the proteinase']

387755	inscuteable homolog (Drosophila)	[u'In Drosophila, neuroblasts divide asymmetrically into another neuroblast at the apical side and a smaller ganglion mother cell on the basal side. Cell polarization is precisely regulated by 2 apically localized multiprotein signaling complexes that are tethered by Inscuteable, which regulates their apical localization (Izaki et al., 2006 [PubMed 16458856]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]', u'May function as an adapter linking the Par3 complex to the GPSM1/GPSM2 complex. Involved in spindle orientation during mitosis it may regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in the developing nervous system. May play a role in the asymmetric division of fibroblasts and participate in the process of stratification of the squamous epithelium.']

131076	coiled-coil domain containing 58	[u'The protein encoded by this gene is a major apoprotein of the chylomicron. It binds to a specific liver and peripheral cell receptor, and is essential for the normal catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein constituents. This gene maps to chromosome 19 in a cluster with the related apolipoprotein C1 and C2 genes. Mutations in this gene result in familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP III), in which increased plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are the consequence of impaired clearance of chylomicron and VLDL remnants. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]', u'Mediates the binding, internalization, and catabolism of lipoprotein particles. It can serve as a ligand for the LDL (apo B/E) receptor and for the specific apo-E receptor (chylomicron remnant) of hepatic tissues']

9	N-acetyltransferase 1 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase)	[]

10	N-acetyltransferase 2 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase)	[]

12	serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A (alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin), member 3	[]

13	arylacetamide deacetylase	[u'Microsomal arylacetamide deacetylase competes against the activity of cytosolic arylamine N-acetyltransferase, which catalyzes one of the initial biotransformation pathways for arylamine and heterocyclic amine carcinogens [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]', u'Displays cellular triglyceride lipase activity in liver, increases the levels of intracellular fatty acids derived from the hydrolysis of newly formed triglyceride stores and plays a role in very low-density lipoprotein assembly. Displays serine esterase activity in liver. Deacetylates a variety of arylacetamide substrates, including xenobiotic compounds and procarcinogens, converting them to the primary arylamide compounds and increasing their toxicity.']

14	angio-associated, migratory cell protein	[u'The gene is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The encoded protein is associated with angiogenesis, with potential roles in endothelial tube formation and the migration of endothelial cells. It may also regulate smooth muscle cell migration via the RhoA pathway. The encoded protein can bind to heparin and may mediate heparin-sensitive cell adhesion. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2014]', u'Plays a role in angiogenesis and cell migration. In smooth muscle cell migration, may act through the RhoA pathway.']
